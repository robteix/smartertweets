Just an experiment to intelligently import tweets into Facebook

Public domain, enjoy it.

To get it to work, you will need to create a FB app so you can have its app
secret and app ID. Edit smarttweets.go to add these.

You will also need to go through FB oauth authorization process manually
as this code doesn't include these steps. As long as you request offline_access
permissions, you only need to do this once. Look at the facebook documentation.
Once you get the access token, edit smarttweets accordingly.

Yes, not friendly... as I said, this was mostly an experiment.
